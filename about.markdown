Hi, Iâ€™m Vincent Fusco, a professional analog circuit designer.

I recently picked up a new hobby: making analog chips using open-source tools. I created this site to document my projects and to share resources with others who might be interested in making their own chips.

Whether you're an experienced professional or a student just getting started, I hope you'll find valuable content here to support your learning and spark ideas for your own projects.
