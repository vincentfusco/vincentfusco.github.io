Hi, Iâ€™m Vincent Fusco, a professional analog circuit designer.

I created this site to document my projects and share resources with others interested in building open source analog chips. 

Whether you're an experienced professional or a student just getting started, I hope you'll find valuable content here to support your learning and spark your own open source projects.
