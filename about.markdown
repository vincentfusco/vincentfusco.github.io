Hi, I’m Vincent Fusco, an Analog IC Designer. Alongside my professional work, I also design analog circuits as a hobby using open-source tools. I created this site to document my projects and to help others learn and experiment with open source analog IC design. Whether you’re an experienced professional or an undergrad just getting started, I hope you’ll find valuable resources and articles to support your work and inspire your own projects.
