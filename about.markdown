Hi, Iâ€™m Vincent Fusco, a professional analog circuit designer.

As a hobby, I design analog ICs using open-source tools, and I created this site to document my projects and share resources with others interested in doing the same.

Whether you're an experienced professional or a student just getting started, I hope you'll find valuable content here to support your learning and spark your own open source projects.
